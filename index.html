            In South Africa, we dont say ‚Äúhello‚Äù, we say ‚Äúhaazit boet‚Äù, and I
            think it‚Äôs beautiful. This talk is called saying what you mean,
            and I hope that by the end of it, you will think about language in
            a new way, and that you will see programming as an extension of
            that, and that you will have learned a few techniques that allow
            you to manipulate how you express yourself in code to write better
            software.

            Linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf): the structure of a language
            influences its speakers' worldview or cognition, and thus
            individuals' languages determine or influence their perceptions
            of the world (?)

            Any fans in the audience of Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi movie
            Arrival? Without spoiling anything, the movie goes into a
            concept called "linguistic relativity", and even mentions by
            name Sapir and Whorf, the two researchers to whom the idea is
            often attributed. The hypothesis is basically that the language
            that you speak and understand to some degree determines or
            influences your thoughts and your worldview. It's quite an
            intuitive idea if you think about it, and there are lots of
            interesting real-world examples that seem to support it.

                Some languages (e.g. Japanese) allow you to drop pronouns;
                instead of saying "I went there", you can just say "went
                there". There seems to be a link between these languages
                where we mention ourselves less frequently, and a more
                collectivist, community-oriented culture.

              <li>
                Guugu Yimithirr (language in North Queensland, Australia)
                doesn't have relative directions (like left, right), only
                absolute directions (like north, south). Speakers of these
                languages tend to always know where north is, even when
                they're inside. This is not a skill most others have!
              </li>
              <li>
                Researchers designed an experiment where speakers of
                English, Japanese and Spanish watched videos of people
                breaking things, either by accident or on purpose. Unlike
                English, Japanese and Spanish doesn't use agentive language
                for accidents - instead of saying "john broke the vase",
                they will say "the vase broke". After watching the videos,
                speakers of these languages were equally likely to remember
                who broke something <i>on purpose</i>, but less likely to
                remember who broke something <i>accidentally</i>.

                In English, time is "stuff" (two days, three hours). We
                think of it as something that can be saved, wasted, lost,
                spent. In Hopi (Native American language) it is seen as a
                cycle. Can you imagine how this might change your outlook?

              <li>
                Even the colour-ignorant among us tend to think of pink as
                its own colour, distinct from red. Is it because it has a
                different name? Russian has different names for darker and
                lighter shades of blue.

              <li>
                The idea is also central to the fictional language
                "Newspeak" imposed by the totalitarian government in George
                Orwell's novel 1984. The idea is that, by making the
                populace speak a language without words for rebellion and
                uprising, they won't be able to think about those concepts.

          Disclaimer: Linguistic determinism probably not real

          <aside class="notes">
            Please note that the strong version of the Sapir Whorf
            hypothesis, aka linguistic determinish, which is that language
            <b>determines</b> thoughts, is pretty much universally rejected
            by linguists; not having a word for something does not restrict
            us from thinking about it. As an example, have you ever said "I
            can't explain how I'm feeling"? However, a looser form of the
            hypothesis really seems to resonate with most people, and be
            supported by empirical evidence. Having or learning a word for a
            concept does seem to help us integrate it into our thinking, and
            more efficiently communicate about that concept with others. We
            might argue that the people in 1984 would still be able to think
            about rebellion, but would have a much harder time organising a
            coup among one another without having the necessary language to
            communicate about it.

        <h2>2. An opinion</h2>
        <p>
          Writing clearly (in code) is a professional responsibility, not an
          optional soft skill.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment">
          Moreover, the process of refining messy code into something clear
          and readable is about more than just writing style; it‚Äôs about
          sorting out your own mental model of the code, organising your
          thoughts, mastering the subject matter, and then putting it down
          clearly, so that others can benefit from your mental efforts.

          So having hopefully convinced you that languge is more than just a necessary evil ‚Äî more than just some
          background medium through which we must wade ‚Äî I hope I can get you onboard with this opinion that I have.
          <br>
          Our job is language. We spend our working days "saying" things, through the act of programming and
          refactoring. And I strongly believe that it doesn't just matter what we say, but that how we say it is vitally
          important.
          <br>
          So as professionals who get paid a fair amount of money, I believe we ought to hold each other accountable for
          mastering the art of language, and writing clearly.
          <br>
          But I want to go deeper and say that it's not just about putting something down in a file that won't make
          others developers hate you when they read it. We've talked about the link between language and mind, and I
          believe that spending the extra effort to find the right way to write a piece of code is about figuring out,
          internally, in your mind, what the code is really trying to say.

          Ok, so far this stuff has been a bit airy-fairy-soft-sciency, and this talk pretty much amounts to "write
          clean code". So
          let's make it more interesting and talk about a specific way in which we can use the nuances of language to
          our advantage. I'd like to tell you about a concept called "making invalid state unrepresentable".
          <br>
          Just like how a natural language might lack a word for something, our code might be written in such a way that
          it
          lacks the ability to express something. We can use this to our advantage to make certain bad things impossible
          to write.
          <br>
          The basic concept is: if it is an error (or a bug) for a program to be in a certain state, then you can
          program it to make it impossible to even represent that state. That way, the error literally cannot occur.
          <br>
          This is a little hard to understand in the abstract, so let‚Äôs look at some concrete examples. We're going to
          talk about 4 strategies or concepts:

          TODO - show and develop a fully-fledged code sample

          <aside class="notes">
            Ok, so we mentioned ‚Äúinvalid state‚Äù. What kind of invalid state are we talking about? An easy example,
            especially if you‚Äôve ever worked in Java or C++, is: unexpected null values. Some of you might get some mild
            PTSD when hearing the phrase ‚ÄúNullPointerException‚Äù.
            <br>
            One way to phrase the problem is that, in languages like Java and C++ and even Go (sorry Go fanboys), for
            many
            types, a value can either be present or it can be null. Now most of the time, we don‚Äôt actually want those
            values to be null when we use them. I mean this in the sense that we don‚Äôt usually assign a special, valid
            meaning to the case where a value is null. Null is often simply an invalid state. Yes, you write your checks
            for it, so if your program is relatively well-written, you shouldn‚Äôt see runtime exceptions. But what if we
            could make that invalid state unrepresentable instead, so that writing a check doesn‚Äôt even make sense?
            <br>
            We can! But we need to reach for monads.
