          <h1>Saying what you mean</h1>
          <p>How precise language eliminates bugs</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            In South Africa, we dont say ‚Äúhello‚Äù, we say ‚Äúhaazit boet‚Äù, and I think it‚Äôs beautiful.

            This talk is called saying what you mean, and I hope that by the end of it, you will think about
            language in a new way, and that you will see programming as an extension of that, and that you
            will have learned a few techniques that allow you to manipulate how you express yourself in code
            to write better software.

            My name is Phlippie. That is my real name. I will not elaborate any further. For money, I work
            as a mobile developer at a cosy little software consultancy called Retro Rabbit. I have some
            stuff on Git Hub, and I blog sometimes and put it on bearblog, which is a super lightweight
            blogging platform built by a South African dev called Herman Martinus; check it out!

            reveal.js. You can view them at this URL, and the source is on github.

          <h3>Language and mind</h3>
          <p class="fragment">Linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf): the structure of a language influences its speakers'
            worldview or cognition, and thus individuals' languages determine or influence their perceptions of the
            world (?)</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            Any fans here of Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi movie Arrival?
            Without spoiling anything, the movie goes into the concept of linguistic relativity, and even mentions by
            name the Sapir and Whorf, two researchers to whom the idea is often attributed.

            The hypothesis is bnasically that the language that you speak and understand, whether to a lesser or
            stronger degree, determines or influences your thoughts and worldview.

            This is quite a popular idea among people

          <blockquote>An existing impasse in the study of this relationship [‚Ä¶] between language and mind [‚Ä¶] cannot be
            overcome as long as the problem itself is not reformulated to rid it of the intrinsically dualistic
            assumption that there is, in fact, a phenomenon called ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô that is ontologically independent of the
            phenomenon called ‚Äòmind.‚Äô [‚Ä¶] mind cannot be understood without and outside of language.</blockquote>

      <section>
        <h2>2. An opinion</h2>
        <p>
          Writing clearly (in code) is a professional responsibility, not an optional soft skill.
        </p>
        <p class="fragment">
          Moreover, the process of refining messy code into something clear and readable is about more than
          just writing style; it‚Äôs about sorting out your own mental model of the code, organising your
          thoughts, mastering the subject matter, and then putting it down clearly, so that others can benefit
          from your mental efforts.

        <aside class="notes">
          Just like a language might lack a word for something, our code might be made to lack the ability to
          express something. We can use this to our advantage to make certain bad things impossible to write.
